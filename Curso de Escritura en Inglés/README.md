## Elementos linguísticos para escribir en inglés

Nouns: Words to designate names, people, animals, things, ideas, etc. They can be singular or plural and they can become possessives.
Example: The **dog** is a great animal and it’s usually consider **humans**’ best **friends**.

Pronouns: Words used to replace specific nouns. We can replace the name Yesica for the pronoun she.
Example: John is a great teacher, **he** always prepares great activities.

Verbs: These are words that express an action; they are supposed to be conjugated accordingly to the moment in which they occur.
Example: I **worked** really hard over the weekend; I’**m** exhausted.

Adjectives: Words that are used to qualify nouns. Generally they are located before the noun and they are never pluralized.
Example: There are many **interesting** courses at Platzi.

Adverbs: The qualify adjectives and verbs. They provide specific information about degree, frequency, place or manner.
Example: The work at the company is **fairly** good.

Prepositions: Words that are used to show the relationship between a noun or a pronoun with the other words of the sentence. Sometimes, prepositions work as meaning modifiers.
Example: The already **on** the platform.

Conjunctions: Words that connect words, sentences or clauses. They are usually classified in “and”, “or” and “but”.
Example: The activities that have to be done are: revising, re-writing **and** publishing.

Punctuation:
* Use CAPITALIZATION whenever you start a sentence.
* Finish every sentence with a punctuation mark like a period, a question mark or a exclamation.
* Use semicolons when you want to separate a clause from another or when you want to introduce a counter argument.
* Use commas to separate elements, or to introduce an idea after a conjunction.

## El proceso de escritura

1. Pre-writing: research about the topic that you are going to be writing about.
2. Pre-composing: start using outline in order to organize the idea.
3. Writing: just write the idea that you already have done in the previous steps.
4. Revision: check what are those mistakes that you made in punctuation, , missing some words, repetitive words, etc.
5. Re-writing: polish into a better version.
6. Checking: reread because maybe you can improve the text.
7. Publish: can be in a Social Media, Magazine, Blog, News, etc.

## Topic Sentence

A topic sentence as the type of sentence that we use when we are starting a paragraph. This is the central idea of a paragraph. 

A topic sentence has components:
* **Topic**: the subject that you are talking about.
* **Controlling Idea**: what is it that you are going to say about that topic.

For example:

**Topic**: moving abroad
**Controlling Idea**: Moving abroad is one of the alternatives that most students take when they are about to finish their programs

**Topic**: Writing
**Controlling Idea**: is one of the hardest language abilities to develop.
**Supporting Details**:
* Requires high order thinking skills.
* Needs analysis and organization.
* Keep the focus
* Maintain a secuence
* Closure

## Outline

* It’s always good to define a structure. We need to plan out what we are going to include in the text.
* It gives us an overview of the text.
* It helps us to accomplish the objectives.

### How to create an outline

Steps to create a good outline:
1. Read extensively
2. Define what the purpose of the text is
3. Define the sections that you will have
4. Identify the ideas you will develop in each section.
5. Close the text.
